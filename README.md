<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was created by me out of my own curiosity to get to know how RESTful APIs work and what can I do with them. The web application has two parts. The first part displays the Covid-19 cases in the whole country by default, with an intuitive graph which can toggle between the confirmed, recovered and deceased cases.
The second displays the statewise cases in the country with a bar graph corresponding to the respective state. The dropdown menu allows the user to choose any state of their choice and then see the cases of the respective state.

Here are some images for Visual Reference:
